st.markdown("""The Pok√©mon franchise revolves around ***1010 fictional species*** of collectible monsters, 
            each having unique designs, skills and powers. Conceived by ***Satoshi Tajiri*** in early 1989,
            Pok√©mon (or Pocket Monsters) are fictional creatures that inhabit the fictional Pok√©mon World. 
            The designs for the multitude of species can draw inspiration from anything such as animals, 
            plants and mythological creatures. Many Pok√©mon are capable of evolving into more powerful 
            species, while others can undergo form changes and achieve similar results. Originally, 
            only a handful of artists led by ***Ken Sugimori*** designed Pok√©mon. However, by 2013 a team 
            of 20 artists worked together to create new species designs. ***Sugimori*** and ***Hironobu Yoshida*** 
            lead the team and determine the final designs.""")

            Each Pok√©mon has one or two "types", such as ***Fire, Water, or Grass.*** 
            In battle, certain types are strong against other types. For example, a Fire-type attack
            will do more damage to a Grass-type Pok√©mon‚Äîrather than a Water-type attack.
            Pok√©mon's abilities like ***Speed***, ***Attack*** and ***Defense*** are given as a certain points which determines
            their effectiveness. For example, a Fire-type Pok√©mon's Speed is given as 10, while a Water-type
            Pok√©mon's Speed is given as 100. Moveover, Their ***Hit points(HP)*** determine how much damage each pok√©mon can receive before
